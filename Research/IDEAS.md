## 2 Where should I dive next?

Scrape various online marine species encyclopedias to get a list of marine species to make online API calls to:
* https://oceana.org/marine-life
* http://species-identification.org/
* https://reefguide.org/index1.html
* https://travel.padi.com/d/caribbean/ (for calender sightings by destination)

Run API Calls to get info on all species gathered on IUCN Red List
Token: 75416e6ead98904da93424788cb69c54d7d3be0f948a17758a7a1c2d316534f1
IUCN Redlist: https://www.iucnredlist.org/

The idea is to have 3 html pages: Landing Page, Species Search, and Country Search. I plan my vacations one of 2 ways: (1) Either I want to see a certain species and I will travel to where it is prevalent, (2) I'm forced to go to a certain place in which case I want to see what species I will find diving.

The countries geojson from here:

## Predict the next terrorist attack

Scrape Wikipedia to get past data on previous terrorist attacks and predict when the next one will be and how bad (by country): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents
